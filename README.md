## Problem Description
Keeping track of one's expenses can be difficult, especially for a busy college student! That is where Budget Better comes in. With Budget Better, users can easily keep track of their monthly expenses, see which categories in which they spend the most, and set their own monthly budget.

## Features

Budget Better tracks the user's location to suggest establishments the user has entered. If the user confirms that they have spent money there, the app then prompts the user to enter the amount spent. The app tracks spending over a monthly cycle and provides a visual display of the amount spent in various categories and against an optional budget set by the user.
